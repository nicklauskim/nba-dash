Welcome to my NBA Statistics Dashboard!

This project is designed to provide an interactive and comprehensive exploration of NBA player statistics, allowing users to dive into and analyze play-by-play data, alongside formatted data tables, shot charts, and other visualizations. The app aims to offer a user-friendly experience for basketball enthusiasts, analysts, and anyone interested in the statistical side of the NBA.

The dashboard is built using Python, leveraging libraries such as Dash for the web interface, Plotly for visualizations, and Pandas for data manipulation. Data was scraped using the nba_api package as well as collected from the nbadata GitHub repo; the data was stored and managed in PostgreSQL and served to the application usinng FastAPI. 

Still working on a catchier name for this project!
